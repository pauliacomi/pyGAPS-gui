# Overview

This file contains summary of development ideas and possible implementations
i.e. a low tech alternative to GitHub project management for my own use.

Functionality:
 - allow change in secondary data chosen
   -
 - BET/langmuir area select which branch
 - characterization copy results button
 - characterisation units (spinbox.setSuffix(" km")?)
 - characterization selection sliders in graph units
 - characterization selection sliders also update isotherm graph somehow
 - characterization fail gracefully if
 - model isotherms with another color/something

Bugs/refactoring:
- isoController : delete does not update selection when deleting checked isotherms
- isoController : delete keeps one item ticked
- material view/iso view adsorbate view / should add a "type" (number/etc) dropdown to each table row
- plotting things with large legends leads to bad plots
- isotherm data widget should resize with column types
- cannot import some things?
- standardize camelcase/underscore
- in most characterization dialogs we are plotting twice in __init__
