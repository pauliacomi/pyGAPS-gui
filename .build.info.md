# Overview

This file contains details about how to perform a build of pygaps-gui (mostly
for me).

The GUI framework used for pyGAPS-GUI is Qt, more specifically its Python
bindings. The official Qt6 bindings are named PySide6 and are herein targeted.
An abstraction layer is used on top of PySide6, called QtPy. This is for ease of
documentation for anyone familiar with other Qt Python bindings.

The pyGAPS-GUI distribution is packed using PyInstaller.

Create a python3.8 virtual environment and activate it:

    python -m venv ./.venv
    ./.venv/Scripts/activate

or using conda:
    conda create -p ./.venv python=3.8
    conda activate ./.venv

Install requirements:

    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -e .[build]

Check it all works

    pygapsgui
    # or
    python pyGAPS-gui.py

Run pyinstaller

    pyinstaller pygaps-gui.spec

This will generate the standalone frozen distribution in `./dist` Next step is
to collect it for the packaging. This is variable, per architecture.
