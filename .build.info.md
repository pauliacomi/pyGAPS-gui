# Overview

This file contains details about how to
perform a build of pygaps-gui (mostly for me).

The GUI framework used for pyGAPS-GUI is Qt, more specifically its Python
bindings. The official Qt6 bindings are named PySide6 and are herein targeted.
An abstraction layer is used on top of PySide6, called QtPy. This is for ease of
documentation for anyone familiar with other Qt Python bindings.

The pyGAPS-GUI distribution is packed using PyInstaller.
